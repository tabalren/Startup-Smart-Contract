# Startup-Smart-Contract

![](Images/SmartContracts_handshake.png)

This code will create an Ethereum-compatible blockchain to be able to build smart contracts. This will enable your company to automate finances for increased transparency and to make accounting and auditing practically automatic!

I have created 2 'Profit Splitter' contracts designed to:

1. Pay employees quickly and easily.
2. Distribute profits to different tiers of employees.
3. Distribute company shares for employees in a "deferred equity incentive plan" automatically.

## Contract 1 - Associate Splitter Contract

This contract is designed to accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among three associate-level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.

Refer to the AssociateProfitSplitter.sol file for the detailed code.


## Contract 2 - Tiered Profit Splitter Contract

This contract will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob the Associate gets 15%.

Refer to the TieredProfitSplitter.sol file for the detail code.
